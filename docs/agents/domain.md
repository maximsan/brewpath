# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

This is a **single-context** repo: one `CONTEXT.md` and one `docs/adr/` at the root.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root — the domain glossary.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.
- **`docs/decisions.md`** — the frozen ledger of pre-Aug-2026 product rulings;
  most glossary terms `§`-cite it. Precedence between sources:
  [`docs/README.md`](../README.md).

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The producer skill (`/grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

(For Flutter/Dart *technology* concepts — not domain terms — the learner's primer is [`learning/glossary.md`](../../learning/glossary.md).)

## File structure

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   └── NNNN-kebab-case-title.md   (one file per recorded decision)
└── lib/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/grill-with-docs`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-NNNN (its title) — but worth reopening because…_
